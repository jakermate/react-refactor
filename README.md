# extractor Component Generator
VSCode extension to take a code block and generate a new component file for it.

Support for
    - React (.jsx, .tsx)
    - Vue (.vue)
    - Svelte (.svelte)

ve any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.

## Extension Settings
This extension contributes the following settings:
