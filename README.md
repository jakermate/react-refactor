VSCode extension providing functions for refactoring React components.


## Features
Methods included:
    - Extract Component to New File
    - Extract Component to Enclosing Scope
    - Extract Component to Module Scope (Global File Level)

## Requirements
This extension requires that VSCode's default <b>Emmet</b> actions/extension is currently enabled.
Methods are provided either through the command palette or editor context menus (editor context menu options will only apprear in .jsx, .tsx, .js) language files.

## Extension Settings
This extension contributes the following settings:

* `extractor.defaultComponentLocation`: "New File"/"Current File" to set default behavior for where to generate new component.  (Current file will only work on certain frameworks that allow for multiple components per file.)
