## Features
Methods included:

## Extension Settings
This extension contributes the following settings:

* `extractor.defaultComponentLocation`: "New File"/"Current File" to set default behavior for where to generate new component.  (Current file will only work on certain frameworks that allow for multiple components per file.)
