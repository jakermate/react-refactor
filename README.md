# Spinoff Component Generator
VSCode extension to take a code block and generate a new component file for it.

## Features

Useful for when you decide a component will be reused more than once, and it should belong to it's own dedicated component file.

Support for
    - React (.jsx, .tsx)
    - Vue (.vue)
    - Svelte (.svelte)

ve any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.

## Extension Settings
This extension contributes the following settings:

* `spinoff.defaultComponentLocation`: "New File"/"Current File" to set default behavior for where to generate new component.  (Current file will only work on certain frameworks that allow for multiple components per file.)
* `spinoff.enableContextMenu`: true/false to enable editor context menu commands
